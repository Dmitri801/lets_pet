### Plan

1.  The App will load to a home screen that has a select input where you can select an animal, and a zip code input where you can search by zip code, below that the list of animals will display once the input is submitted.

2.  You may click on an individual animal in the list and it will take you to the animal detail page, there you will see full details about the animal that includes location, breed, phone number, email, shelter Id, more pictures to view.

**OPTIONAL**

3.  Create a Page that has a list of "favorited" animals that will save on your phone through AsyncStorage.
